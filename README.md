# Zone 2 Fat-Burn Tracker

This project helps users stay in the optimal heart rate zone for fat-burning workouts by providing real-time tracking and live feedback based on personalised health data.

---

## Goals

- Calculate a user's ideal Zone 2 heart rate range based on age, height, weight, etc.
- Use a heart rate sensor (like MAX30102) to get live data
- Provide live feedback when the user is in or out of Zone 2

---

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- Python
- Raspberry Pi
- MAX30102 heart rate sensor
- AI for personalisation (planned for later)

---

## Current Progress

- [ ] Basic project structure
- [ ] User input system (age, weight, etc.)
- [ ] Heart rate simulator
- [ ] Sensor integration
- [ ] Zone 2 calculation function
- [ ] Simple visualisation

## Notes

> I'm passionate about fitness and wanted to create a tool that optimises fat-burning workouts by guiding users into their ideal heart rate zone for fat loss.
> This is also a personal learning project â€” I'm using it to practice GitHub, Python, and Raspberry Pi development.  
> The goal is to make something useful for myself and others who care about smart, data-driven training.
